# Afame-Technologies

This are my projects during my internship with Afame Technologies as a Data Analyst Intern.

Project-1:
It is based on HR Data Analysis where I have removed the unnecessary columns using Python Pandas libraries and renamed those columns into useful column names and sanitizing those columns for further analysis.

Project 2:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset aimed at uncovering initial patterns, spotting anomalies, testing hypotheses, and checking assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. The Titanic dataset typically includes information on passengers such as age, gender, fare, class, and whether they survived the disaster.

Project 3:
ECOMM data analysis project involves delving into a substantial sales dataset to extract valuable insights for business decision-making. Through comprehensive analysis, including computing total sales, examining sales trends over time, and identifying the best-selling products, the aim is to uncover patterns and revenue indicators crucial for enhancing sales strategies. By leveraging visualizations and data-driven suggestions, the project showcases the ability to derive actionable recommendations from large datasets, ultimately empowering businesses to make informed decisions to drive growth and profitability.
