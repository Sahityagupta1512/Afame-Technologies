Project-1:
It is based on HR Data Analysis where I have removed the unnecessary columns using Python Pandas libraries and renamed those columns into useful column names and sanitizing those columns for further analysis.

Project 2:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset aimed at uncovering initial patterns, spotting anomalies, testing hypotheses, and checking assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. The Titanic dataset typically includes information on passengers such as age, gender, fare, class, and whether they survived the disaster.
